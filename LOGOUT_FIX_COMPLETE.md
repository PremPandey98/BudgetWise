# Logout Functionality - Fixed! ✅

## 🐛 **Issue Found:**
The DashboardScreen had an incomplete logout implementation that only removed `USER_DATA` but didn't use the `TokenManager` to clear all tokens properly.

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied:**

### 1. **Updated DashboardScreen Logout:**
- ✅ Added proper `TokenManager.clearAllTokens()` call
- ✅ Added `userAPI.logout()` API call
- ✅ Clear all user-related storage keys
- ✅ Added navigation trigger for AppNavigator detection

### 2. **Enhanced ProfileScreen Logout:**
- ✅ Added navigation trigger for better logout detection
- ✅ Consistent logout flow across both screens

### 3. **Complete Logout Process Now:**
1. **API Logout Call** - Notifies backend to invalidate token
2. **Clear All Tokens** - Uses `TokenManager.clearAllTokens()` to remove:
   - Personal tokens
   - Group/context tokens  
   - Active group data
3. **Clear Additional Data** - Removes user groups and app settings
4. **Trigger Navigation** - Forces AppNavigator to detect logout immediately
5. **Auto-Redirect** - AppNavigator switches to auth screens

## 🧪 **How to Test Logout:**

### **From Profile Screen:**
1. Go to Profile tab
2. Tap "Logout" (red menu item)
3. Confirm in the popup
4. Should redirect to Home/Login screen

### **From Dashboard Screen:**
1. Go to Dashboard (Home tab)
2. Look for logout button/option
3. Confirm logout
4. Should redirect to Home/Login screen

### **Expected Console Logs:**
```
🚪 Starting logout process...
✅ Logout API call successful
🧹 All data cleared from storage  
🔄 AppNavigator will detect logout and switch to auth screens
🔍 Login check - User data exists: false
```
